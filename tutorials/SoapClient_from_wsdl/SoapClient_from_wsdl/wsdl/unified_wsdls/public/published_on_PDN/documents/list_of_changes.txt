General: 
Stylesheet was added to all WSDLS

WSDL Specific:

1) AlarmArrayConfiguration: None

2) AudioInput: None

3) AudioInputRtsp: None

4) AudioOutput:
-> Merged AudioOutput wsdl with that in api/trunk. The actions GetSessionParameters, SetStreamPriority, GetStreamPriority and associated types got added into the GM version.

5) CameraConfiguration: 
-> Merged with Miranda version of this wsdl; Anonymous complexType pulled from maxUnicast element and moved to a named type. 
This was required by Miranda because when generating code in gsoap, anonymous types are given a numerical value when defining 
the c/c++ type, which can change depending on processing order.

6) DeviceCapability: 
-> Merged pelco_api_1 and Miranda versions. This means that anonymous complexType  was pulled from AdvancedSharpening element 
and moved to a named type EnabledElement. This was required because when generating code in gsoap, annonymous types are given
a numerical value when defining the c/c++ type, which can change depending on processing order.

-> I could not find this wsdl in the trunk, so this merge is it.

7) DeviceRegistry:
-> complexType "UpnpDvcQuery" had 4 elements in trunk, 'queryFlags', 'upnpStates', 'stateDeltaSeqNum', and 'dvcTypeQueryStrs'.
It had an extra element in pelco_api_1 'attrQueryStrs'. Included this in the GM version.

-> complexType name="Item" has extra element in pelco_api_1 called svcInfo. Added this to GM

-> Many actions defined in the trunk were missing from pelco_api_1. Added all of them to GM.

-> Update: Added style="document" in the <soap:binding line on the request of the Miranda team.

8) ImagingConfiguration: 
-> Merged with trunk, this means a few lines of documentation were added.

9) LensControl:
-> Merged LensControl with that in api/trunk which means that SetMaxMag action got added to this wsdl. 
-> Miranda and PDN versions were identical.

10) MetaData: None

11) MonitorConfiguration:
-> Incorporated changes for APITEST-772 into GM.

12) MotionDetection: None

13)  PelcoConfiguration:
-> The trunk had specified a style="document" attribute in the <soap:binding line for <wsdl:binding name="PelcoConfiguration".
Since this attribute was not there in the pelco_api_1 version, I did not include it in the GM version.
Update: Added style="document" to both pelco_api/public and private versions on request from the Miranda team.

-> Merged pelco_api_1 with trunk. The documentation is the same, but with different formatting - took in the documentation from the trunk. 

-> The following acions got added as a result of this merge: 
SetDescription, SetConfiguration, ResetConfiguration, Restart, ResetSecurity, ResetSynched. 

-> Also, in the complexType "Port"; a required="true" was added for the attributes "in", "out" and "search".	

14) PositioningControl: 
-> Merged with trunk. This means that SetVelocityLimits and SetPositionLimits got added to the GM wsdl.

15) RelayArrayConfiguration: 
-> Merged with Miranda version of this wsdl which means that 'minOccurs=0' was added to 'enabled' type. 
Refer [MIR-124] - Relay::SetConfiguration with missing enabled element causes relays to be disabled (workstation does not provided 'enabled' element)

16) ScriptControl: 
-> Merged with trunk. This means that actions UploadScript, DownloadScript, SetScriptOwner, and QueryActions 
were added to the GM version. 

-> Also, the documentation of BeginScript operation was taken from pelco_api_1 since the documentation was more
recent in that version as compared to the trunk.

17) SoftwareUpdate: 
-> Merged with Miranda and trunk. This means that action Update and associated types was added to the GM wsdl.
-> moved service definition block from top of file to bottom. 

18) StreamConfiguration: None. 
The documentation is better in pelco_api_1 as compared to Miranda and trunk so keeping documentation of pelco_api_1 in the GM.

19) StreamControl: 
-> Merged pelco_api_1 and Miranda versions. This means that element 'asyncId' was added to the elements called 
'PlayResponse', 'Pause', and 'PauseResponse'. 

-> Some actions were missing in the Miranda version so I retained all the actions defined in the pelco_api_1 version for the GM.

-> Merged with trunk. This means that action GetStreamTime got added to the GM.

20) StreamDiscovery: None

21) SystemManagerLocator: 
-> Merged with trunk. This means documentation got added.

22) UserAndRole: 
-> Merged with trunk. wsdl on pelco_api_1 had 2 actions UserLogin and UserLogout.wsdl on trunk had 43 actions. 
This means that 41 actions were added to the GM version of the WSDL as a result of this merge.

23) VideoInput: 
-> Merged with trunk. This means Query action and its associated types got added to the GM wsdl. 
-> Also changed the last documentation in the file to be a mix of what was in the pelco_api_1 and trunk.

24) VideoOutput:
-> In simpleType RESOLUTIONS, added string restriction enumeration value "" otherwise the schema for requests
from Endura workstation did not match and soap would generate a fault. (<xsd:enumeration value=""/>, added enumeration). 
This change was needed by Miranda.
	   
-> In complexType 'Compatibility', the element 'resolution' is of type 'string' in the trunk, while it is of 
type 'tns:Resolution' in pelco_api_1 and Miranda. Changed this to be of type tns:Resolution in the GM wsdl.
Note: Vishal Aggarwal had reverted this change from the trunk for 'backwards compatibility'. We need to make sure that changing 
'string' to 'tns:Resolution' is acceptable.
	   
-> Add GetStreamPriority and SetStreamPriority and associated types from trunk to GM WSDL. These actions are missing from 
pelco_api_1 branch and Miranda.
	   
25) fault.xsd: Merged with trunk. This means that ProfileAlreadyExistsFaultType and ProfileDoesNotExistFaultType got added.

Suggested changes:

1) DeviceCapability name should be changed to DeviceCapabilityV1.
